This is a classic radar application for Albion Online. It emits events via WebSocket.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is not actively maintained, as I do not wish to keep up with frequent game updates.

To run the application, simply use:

sh
Copier
Modifier
npm start
A huge thanks to other open-source projects on GitHub—without them, this project wouldn't have been possible.
